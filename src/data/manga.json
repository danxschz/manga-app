Attacked by a strange, four-legged fish in their cabin, they manage to kill it, but are left unsettled by the putrid stench it carried—the haunting smell of death. This lone assault is only the herald of what's to come, as soon, many more such creatures emerge from the sea, attacking anything in their path. Though Tadashi and Kaori quickly return to Tokyo, they find there is no longer any safe haven; no matter where they run, the death stench creeps... Amigara Dansou no Kai (The Enigma of Amigara Fault) After a devastating earthquake near Amigara mountain, a several-kilometer-long fault emerged. But this discovery was made more eerie by the thousands of human-shaped holes scattered among the rock face, each of which seemingly continues for miles within the mountain. Oowaki, one of the many spectators attracted to the sight, witnesses in horror as onlookers start to experience a personal, visceral calling to enter these holes—formed as if to fit only them. Daikokubashira Hiwa (The Sad Tale of the Principal Post) Celebrating their recent move into their new house, a family's festivities are cut short upon hearing the cries of their father. Finding him in the crawl space below, they bear witness to the bizarre and unexplainable tragedy that has befallen him. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

I wouldn't recommend reading this after you've eaten, as some of the images are gruesome enough to make your stomach do loop-de-loops in your chest. The story however is very creative, and has many twists and turns you don't see coming, so if you have some down time, drop by onemanga or buy the manga if you have some extra cash, plop yourself down, and you'll never want to eat Sushi again.",

        "synopsis": "Ice Cream Bus After Sonohara, a divorcee, moves into a new condo with his son Tomoki, he learns of an ice cream truck that makes regular visits to the complex. Furthermore, the driver—a silent, handsome man—offers a service of driving the children around town while they enjoy their ice cream. Although initially reluctant, Sonohara soon concedes and lets Tomoki join in. But as time passes, Sonohara begins to notice the horrifying effects his choice has on Tomoki. Nakama no Ie (Clubhouse) When friends Chikako and Minae find the local abandoned house unlocked, they boldly decide to enter it. While the girls split up to explore the house, their friend Yukari stays outside. When they exit, however, Yukari notices that the two appear strangely shaken by whatever they witnessed. Not long after, Chikako and Minae start behaving bizarrely, refusing to talk to each other, leaving Yukari in an awkward position. But when Yukari starts to learn the history of the building, the reason behind her friends' change of heart starts to become frighteningly clear. Tobacco-kai (The Smoking Club) At school, the male students have taken to smoking. Looking to avoid being punished for smoking on school grounds, the boys set up an afterschool smoking club headed by Nakaya, who provides his own tobacco. Invited by his friend Shirai to join, Kondou attends the club—only to gradually realize the disturbing repercussions of Nakaya's unearthly cigarettes. Chuuko Record (Used Record) Enraptured by the hauntingly captivating song on her friend Ogawa's coveted record, Nakayama is curious about its origin and singer. Oddly enough, Ogawa refuses Nakayama's requests to copy, borrow, or even know how she obtained it. Fed up with her non-compliance, Nakayama impulsively steals the record, which sets her on a path to uncovering its disquieting origin. Suima no Heya (Den of the Sleep Demon) Aspiring writer Yuuji has gone without sleep for three days and seeks his friend Mari for help with his peculiar problem. In his dreams, another version of Yuuji exists and is looking to break out into the real world. Worried about this entity's intentions, he asks Mari to watch over and stop him from dozing off to ensure that the sleep demon cannot cross over. Thus begins their struggle against this otherworldly intruder. Okuru Hito (The Gift Bearer) Sousuke Ookura is a cold-blooded businessman who always puts himself above others to get what he wants. Consequently, a rival company hires a professional hypnotist to deal with him. The expert orders Ookura to forget his selfish ways and wholeheartedly devote himself to society and people's happiness. Some 14 years later, the hypnotist returns to the town to see the fruit of his labor. But what he finds is an odd young man who goes around town giving unwanted presents to people. Deciding to follow this man, the hypnotist soon discovers the disaster his work has wrought. Ayatsuri Yashiki (Marionette Mansion) When Haruhiko Kitawaki was young, he traveled from town to town with his poor family, relying solely on the meager income that came from performing his father's puppet shows. His older brother, Yukihiko, was never fond of the practice and left the family as soon as he could. When their father fell ill and died, Haruhiko and his sister, Natsumi, were forced to leave behind the touring life and live with relatives. Years later, Haruhiko receives a letter from Yukihiko, inviting him to his house. Along with Natsumi, the siblings reunite; unexpectedly, Haruhiko finds that his brother has embraced puppeteering again, taking it to an eerily personal level. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Chidamagi (Blood-bubble Bushes) During a joyride through the countryside, lovers Ansai and Kana crash when a splatter of blood hits their windshield. Unable to discern where the blood came from or to get their car working again, the couple venture off the road for help. Though they come across a group of boys, these eerie children only attack the couple and attempt to suck their blood. Chased into an abandoned village, the pair find shelter in a mansion occupied by the village's sole inhabitant. Staying the night, the man begins to recount to them a strange and sorrowful tale of his past, the tragic circumstances of the town, and the existence of a phenomena known as blood-bubbles that links them all. Taegatai Meiro (Unbearable Labyrinth) Sayako is a troubled youth who has stopped attending school due to a personal trauma. Out of concern, her friend Noriko takes her on a hike in the calm mountainside, hoping to convince her to return. They get lost on the trail and come across a group of monks. However, their requests for assistance are only met by vacant stares from the gaunt men. Their superior explains that the monks are in training and that the girls have stumbled upon a sacred area, one that is hard to enter, and hard to leave. The girls are invited to spend the night at the temple, where they will find out the extremes that the monks will go through to achieve their nirvana. Re-Animator no Tsurugi (Sword of the Re-Animator) On a night of ghost hunting, Keiji Soga witnesses a whole swarm of spectres heading in a single direction. He tracks them down to find them entering the body of a cloaked man. Noticing the witness, the strange man unsheathes his mystical sword and attempts to silence Keiji. Though Keiji manages to escape, he finds that this is not the last time he will meet this man, and that they are more connected than he knows. Isho (The Will) Hiroko's younger sister Taeko has committed suicide by jumping in front of a train. A note she left behind reveals she killed herself out of hatred, but her blood obscured who the letter was addressed to. Taeko had always felt that Hiroko was treated better than her, and died after finding out she was adopted, causing Hiroko and her family to fear they may have been the cause of Taeko's death. When a vengeful spirit appears in their house, they start to fear that their worries have been realized... Hashi (The Bridge) After receiving a worrying call from her grandmother Osode, Kanako decides to visit her village. Upon arriving, an old figure stands at the bridge, but much to her horror, Kanako finds that this figure is a walking corpse. Osode explains that the man is actually her long-deceased uncle, and is tethered to the mortal realm as a result of the village's unique funeral practice. However, this single entity is not Osode's main problem; as of late, all the trapped souls of the village have appeared, urging Osode to join them in their rest. Akuma no Riron (The Devil’s Logic/Demonology) Kazumi Morimoto was a cheerful schoolgirl eager to go on her first date with her crush. One hour later, she jumped off her school's roof to her demise. Her classmate Okamori could only watch this scene helplessly, leaving him puzzled as to what would lead her to such an act. However, when a tape recorder that he had mischievously slipped into her bag prior finds its way back to him, he realizes that it will serve as a key to the mystery. As Okamori listens to the tape, he comes to hear of the sinister being that Morimoto met in her last hour... Aibeya (The Conversation Room) Following a sudden car accident, Hashimoto awakens in a hospital ward. She finds herself in the company of Sugie, the woman she crashed into, and four other female patients. Though Sugie proves unbearable by pinning all the blame on Hashimoto, she finds herself more taken aback by the four women and their strange behaviour. This quartet acts in unison, claim that their hearts are one, and even seem to share the same dreams. Above all, they do not wish to be separated. As she spends more time in the hospital, Hashimoto starts to learn about the horrifying truth behind these women and the danger of staying with them. [Written by MAL Rewrite] \n\n1.

        "synopsis": "Yaneura no Nagai Kami (Long Hair in the Attic) The beautiful, long-haired Chiemi Amano has just been dumped by her playboy boyfriend, leaving her utterly dejected. Returning home, she begins to recall fond memories, such as how she grew her hair out for him. But now, these once pleasant recollections only further her depression, leading her to decide that cutting off her hair can free her from the heartbreak. However, she finds that doing so is no longer a decision she can make... Yurushi (Approval/Permission) Again and again, Kyousuke has been trying to get permission to marry his love Misuzu. Yet no matter how many times he asks her father, he is repeatedly denied due to his low social standing. After countless months, Kyousuke finally gives up and breaks things off with Misuzu. Only later does she come to him and plead for him to return. But strange events have unfolded while Kyousuke was absent, and he may not be prepared for the truth that faces him. Hachi no Su (Beehive) Takano is an adamant fan of bees and makes beehive collecting a hobby of his. His only rival in the neighbourhood is a strange, unkempt boy, who handles bees as if he were one of them. But one day, the boy goes missing, and rumours circulate that his ghost is haunting the woods. When Takano spots a rare hornet, he sets off towards the woods to chase it, where the truth of the boy's disappearance will be unveiled... Hakumei (Dying Young) Ayako and her friends Chizuru and Hiroko belong to a group deemed \"The Ugly Trio\" due to their less-than-stellar looks. That is until Chizuru mysteriously starts to undergo a slow transformation, becoming prettier and prettier by the day. However, the prettier she gets, the less healthy she becomes, and soon —after becoming a lovely beauty—Chizuru collapses and dies. This event sets the precedent of what's to come, as slowly more and more girls start to become prettier... Kubi no Nai Choukoku (Headless Sculptures) Though friends Shimada and Rumi regularly walk home together, Rumi finds herself going alone one day when Shimada stays behind to help Mr. Okabe. An art teacher dedicated to crafting headless sculptures, Mr. Okabe enlists Shimada's help to meet the deadline for his next exhibition. But when Rumi goes to pick up Shimada the next day, he oddly refuses and stays home. At school, Rumi is met with shocking news: Mr. Okabe has been gruesomely decapitated, and his head is still missing. When Rumi tries to question Shimada for information, he tells her to follow him to the art room, within which the truth lies. Niku-iro no Kai (Flesh-Colored Horror) Walking home alone one night, kindergarten teacher Momoko Takigawa is assaulted by a shadowy figure who throws a sticky substance onto her. Hard enough to get off her skin, Momoko is left with no choice but to cut her hair short to remove it. Back at school, Momoko has a tough time handling her problem student, Chikara—a boy who stands out for his rough skin and violent fixation on peeling whatever's around him. Momoko decides that visiting Chikara's home for counsel may help. But in this attempt to remedy Chikara's issues, Momoko finds herself coming into contact with her mysterious attacker once more.

        "synopsis": "Kao Dorobou (The Face Burglar) When problem student Yumi Machida transfers to a new school, one sight stands out to her: two girls in her class look like identical twins. Very soon one of the twins starts following Yumi around, much to her chagrin. Yumi finds that this girl, known as Kamei, is determined to be with her as often as possible. However, despite attempting to ward Kamei away, Yumi finds herself swept into a sinister plan, for Kamei is neither who she says she is, nor who she appears to be. Kakashi (Scarecrows) Though it's been weeks since her funeral, Numata consistently visits his daughter Yuki's grave. When he spots Toshio—Yuki's former lover—paying his respects, he blames him for her death. In an impulsive rage, Numata plucks a scarecrow from the nearby fields and posts it in Yuki's grave to ward Toshio off. When he later comes to remove the scarecrow, Numata finds that its appearance has somewhat changed. In a matter of days, it now closely resembles his deceased daughter. Soon, the whole village follows suit, planting scarecrows into their loved one's graves to bring back their semblance. But with their return come the secrets that they were supposed to be buried with. Rakka (Falling) In the midst of an outbreak of suicides, a man catches his wife Erika trying to hang herself. Though he is able to rescue her, all she asks him thereafter is why he didn't let her die. The following day, Erika, along with hundreds of patients, hypnotically leave the hospital and disappear from the town completely. The town looks but to no avail, only finding Erika in a tree, still wishing to die. Clueless as to what is happening, the answer will soon come falling down to them. Akai Ito (Red String) Ishii has been dumped by his girlfriend Momoko Sakurai, leading him to skip school for the next three days in order to get over his heartache. When he returns, he discovers some strange red stitching on his wrist, and even more on his stomach later. With no help from doctors and no way to cut it, Ishii must struggle to discover the source and cure of his rapidly developing problem before it completely envelops him. Gosenzo-sama (My Dear Ancestors) When Makita finds his friend Risa aimlessly wandering through town, he discovers that she has lost her memories. Seeking medical help, the doctor determines that she likely witnessed something traumatic before losing her memories. Recuperating at home, Risa is plagued by nightmares of giant caterpillars but is no closer to revealing what she saw. Makita wants to help bring back her memories, and requests her to come over to his house. However, Risa only feels unease upon entering... Kubitsuri Kikyuu (The Hanging Balloons) Kazuko's friend, the popular idol Fujino Terumi, has committed suicide by hanging herself in public. As the news of her death spreads around, so does a wave of copycat suicides, giving rise to rumors of Terumi's ghost. With these rumors come strange but detailed reports that Terumi's ghost has manifested as her giant, floating head. As Kazuko starts to investigate, she realizes that these strange incidents are merely the beginning of the end.",

While his parents are out working abroad, he lives alone in a big mansion, compounding his loneliness and affecting his grip on reality. Moreover, strange things tend to happen to him and those he gets involved with. Grappling with harrowing hallucinations of long-necked people, a haunted bog rumoured to trap its victims, a strange girl with even stranger penpals, and the mysterious circumstances within his own house, it seems the supernatural is all but an inevitable occurrence for Oshikiri. Yet with each inexplicable occurrence, his reality alters slightly between the last. Just what is the truth behind these discrepancies? Is this really happening to the same Oshikiri?

        "synopsis": "Michi no Nai Machi (The Town Without Streets) Saiko has been having odd dreams as of late. She constantly dreams of her classmate Kishimoto, but as he hardly stands out, she is puzzled as to why he appears so often. Her friend suggests an answer: Kishimoto may be whispering to her in her sleep to influence her thoughts. Ready to confront him, Saiko soon finds this act to be merely the beginning of a strange series of events threatening to rob all of her privacy. Near Miss! Former university classmates, Konishi, Kawaguchi, and Takashio are set for a long overdue reunion. With Kawaguchi already having met up with Konishi and his sister, the group waits for Takashio's plane to land. However, when they discover that his flight has apparently gone missing, Konishi takes immediate action and heads to the airstrip. Together, the group sets out in Konishi's plane to find their friend, but nothing can prepare them for the sight they witness. Chizu no Machi (Maptown) On their honeymoon, Miki and Hiroshi spontaneously decide on a town to visit and celebrate in. They end up picking Shirube, whose streets are riddled with maps and guideposts, something they pass off as the quaintness of the location. Soon, they discover that the residents cannot get by without these maps, as the longer one stays in Shirube, the worse their sense of direction becomes. However, after hearing that there is also a hidden treasure within the town, the newlyweds decide to search for this prize, taking the risk that Shirube presents. Siren no Mura (Village of the Siren) In the midst of a nationwide epidemic of infant abductions, Kyouichi finds himself returning to his home village after receiving word that his parents have abandoned their farmwork in favor of working at the village's new factory. Kyouichi is puzzled, as his parents had been deeply passionate about their farm, making their abrupt decision nonsensical. At the village, he finds nothing but oddities: the desertion of the village, the few remaining people exhibiting strange behaviour, and the even fewer normal ones gripped in fear of the factory's siren. By evening, when the siren rings through the village, the terrible truth is revealed to Kyouichi. Choushizen Tenkousei (The Supernatural Transfer Student) The supernatural club is home to believers and performers of the strange and paranormal. Hikaru Shibayama can bend spoons with his mind and Kiyoshi Kitagawa can see the inner spirits of people and objects. When new transfer student Ryou Tsukano expresses his love for the occult, he seems a natural fit for the club and joins. But the group soon finds Ryou to be a frightening addition to the club, for his very presence is an invitation for the bizarre. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Namekuji Shoujo (Slug Girl) Yuuko, Rie's once outgoing friend, has become quite sluggish as of late. She is quiet in class, her speech is slurred, and her attitude is listless. Soon, she completely stops coming to school. Upon visiting her house, Rie finds Yuuko bedridden and tenaciously adamant that no one sees what is happening to her; for Yuuko, an irreversible Kafkaesque transformation has already begun. Hyouchakubutsu (Out of Its Element/Thing that Drifted Ashore) A strange sea creature unlike anything seen before has drifted ashore. Like something out of a nightmare, this massive, eel-like monstrosity attracts a crowd of curious onlookers. But as they begin to investigate further, the sickening truth of this beast bursts forth. Kabi (Mold) After a year of working abroad, Akasaka finally returns home to enjoy the comfort of his house. At his brother's insistence, Akasaka had reluctantly rented it out to his former science teacher Mr. Shimao Rogi and his family. Now, upon his return, he finds the house in a filthy state and the Rogi family is nowhere to be seen. His problems only worsen once he finds mold all over the place, relentlessly spreading through every crevice, threatening to engulf his home and him with it. Samuke (Shiver/Coldness) In the backyard of his housing complex, Yuuji often spots his neighbour Rina, an odd girl with mysterious holes throughout her arms. Her strange condition reminds Yuuji of a grim memory: when he was a boy, his grandfather had succumbed to a disease that also covered his body with holes. When he consults his friend Hideo about the connection, the two discover a journal kept by Yuuji's grandfather and find themselves closer to understanding the chilling truth of this enigmatic condition. Ryokan When Mitsuyo was young, her father was overtaken by a strange passion to convert their house into a traditional inn. No matter how much her mother reminded him of the sheer impracticability of his goal, he refused to listen. As their father was driven to madness, Mitsuyo and her mother soon left. Intrigued by her story, Mitsuyo's friend decides to seek out the inn and see how it has fared in the 10 years since their departure. But when he arrives, he finds it to be distinctly not of this earth... Umeku Haisuikan (The Groaning Drain) Having lived under the strict regimen of their clean-freak mother, Reina and Mari Shimizu have always upheld high standards of cleanliness. So when Numei, a slovenly and repulsive student, begins to romantically pursue Reina, she is utterly disgusted and rejects him. However, Numei does not listen and continues to stalk Reina. Thus, Mari devises a cruel plan to turn him away from her sister, oblivious to the horrific consequences it may unleash. Bio House Kubota, a new secretary at a biotechnology firm, has been invited to dinner at the company president's mansion. Business talks are not the main course of the evening however; both are interested in \"gross\" foods, and the president has prepared a grand banquet of odd delicacies. Although Kubota may have a fondness for the cuisine, the president's tastes prove to be more than she can chew. What's more, when Kubota rejects the president's downright revolting \"special dish,\" she finds that her night of torment has only just begun. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This time, he attempts to capitalize on his mystic powers, play his hand at popularity, pester his grandfather into building him a coffin, and as usual, torment his elder brother Kouchi. And like always, his shenanigans tend to backfire on him, though this time they may have a more lasting effect... Fashion Model Amateur scriptwriter Iwasaki awakens one day to a bad feeling, which means something very unpleasant is inbound. Flipping through a fashion magazine, he comes across an eerie model who sports a visage straight from a nightmare. Her unsettling countenance haunts Iwasaki for weeks and festers in his mind, growing more and more monstrous. It is only with the passage of time that this frightening image fades away. However, when his film crew decides to open casting calls for their next project, his disturbing premonition returns once more... [Written by MAL Rewrite] \n\n1. Souichi's Selfish Curse \n2.

Though they haven't met in years, they quickly find that they're in for a relaxing vacation: they get along well with their cousins Kouchi and Sayuri Tsujii, there's a pool within walking distance, and the scenery is ever refreshing. There is just one blight upon this otherwise lovely trip: Souichi Tsujii, the bratty third Tsujii child and black sheep of the family. Nail-sucking, occult-loving, and utterly mischievous, Souichi's idea of amusement is anything that makes others squirm. Whether its throwing curses on his cousins, bewitching his classmates, or replacing his teachers with living dolls, Souichi finds all kinds of ways to ruin the fun that he's left out of. But even with his own mystical powers, his havoc never lasts too long: for when Souichi causes trouble, it always comes back his way. [Written by MAL Rewrite] \n\n1. Fun Summer Vacation \n2.

Thanks to the unique weather, one game has become commonplace among the residents: intersection fortune-telling, where strangers meet up at crossroads to ask for anonymous advice. Though fun and exciting for most, this game holds nothing but dark memories for Ryuusuke, for when he was a child, his involvement had disastrous results for the other player. As a result, these memories hinder Ryuusuke's return to the town, as well as his reunion with his childhood friend Midori Shibayama. With Ryuusuke's arrival however, a new figure emerges in this game: the Intersections Pretty Boy. This devilishly handsome but wicked presence gives nothing but cruel and harsh advice to anyone who has the misfortune of crossing his path. What's more, his advice has bewitching effects on those he encounters. With tragic results spreading as a consequence, Ryuusuke determines to prevent this man from repeating the past. But can he stop this enigmatic figure, or do only torment and misery await those who try? [Written by MAL Rewrite] \n\n1. Yotsutsuji no Bishounen (The Beautiful Youth of the Intersections) \n2.

        "synopsis": "Frankenstein Victor Frankenstein is a promising Swiss noble and passionate scientist who seeks to unlock the very mysteries of life. Driven by the desire to create his own living being, Victor begins constructing a creature from the parts of the deceased. Though successful in bringing it to life, his triumph quickly turns to horror as he finds his creation to be an utterly revolting and unsightly beast. Having passed out in shock, Victor awakens to find his creation gone. Soon, he works to forget his former passion and distance himself from his transgression. However, when the creature reemerges into his life, Victor finds he must deal with a vengeance-seeking fiend, lest he lose all that he holds precious in life. Jigoku no Ningyousou (A Doll's Hellish Burial) In the midst of a worldwide epidemic where girls slowly transform into lifeless dolls, two parents find their child Marie has been infected. Though the couple love their daughter, they must decide their course of action: bury her and end their torment, or spare her no matter what she may become. Real Unko no Omoide (Memories of Real Shit) The horror mangaka Junji Itou recalls a vivid memory from his childhood. When at a festival, he came across a stall that seemed to sell real feces. Though it was just a toy, the sight created a burning desire in the mischievous boy... [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Frankenstein is an adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 gothic horror novel of the same title. While generally a faithful adaptation, the story diverges from the original in the final third where Junji Itou provides his unique spin on the story. Frankenstein and Jigoku no Ningyousou were published in English (the latter as The Hell of the Doll Funeral) by VIZ Media as a part of their Junji Itou story collection Frankenstein.",

        "synopsis": "In a futuristic Japan, astrologist Tsuneo Ooguro has made a monumental achievement: he has discovered a new planet from another universe. The discovery propels the professor into the public eye, where he is met with accolades, acclaim, and the rights to name the planet. Deciding to let his daughter Remina serve as the namesake, the shy girl quickly finds herself thrust into an uneasy life of stardom. Unlike its human counterpart, planet Remina shows nothing but odd behavior. Its movements are unpredictable and show no clear orbital patterns. Even more mysterious, any star it nears soon disappears. The enigma heightens when Professor Ooguro's assistant claims that planet Remina has stopped moving and looked him directly in the eye. Before going mad, the assistant announces one final thing: the planet is now heading toward Earth. Soon enough, planet Remina enters the solar system, leaving a trail of emptiness and causing worldwide panic. In an instant, popular adoration transforms into hostility; the populace have declared that the Ooguros have orchestrated this disaster and must be destroyed to avert it. Now deemed Public Enemy No. 1, Remina must escape a rabid population, all while the looming threat of the hellstar approaches. [Written by MAL Rewrite] Included one-shot: Okuman Bocchi",

As he burrows in its folds, what sort of unseen horror is he hiding from? Mokuzou no Kai (Wooden Spirit) More than anything else, Megumi and her father are proud of their house's pedigree, as it has been recently honored as a national tangible cultural property. This renown draws the interest of architecture student Manami Kino, who ends up boarding alongside the father-daughter pair. As Manami becomes more ingrained in their lives, she reveals tell-tale signs of her love for the house. Tomio: Akai High-neck (Tomio・Red Turtleneck) Clad in a crimson turtleneck and clutching the sides of his head, Tomio begs for his ex-girlfriend Madoka's help. The enchanting fortune-teller who stole his heart now wants to steal another thing—Tomio's head. Lacerations wind around his neck, and the only thing keeping him whole is the waning strength of his hands. Yuruyaka na Wakare (Gentle Goodbye) Against his family's wishes, Makoto Tokura marries Riko. Soon, she learns of the family's special ritual. They have the ability to bring back the ghosts of the dead, calling them \"afterimages.\" After a couple of decades, these afterimages will fade, but they grant family members the chance to say a gentle goodbye to loved ones. Riko hopes the family can bring back the afterimage of her father when he dies, but even after years, they still don't approve of her. What secret could they be hiding? Kaibou-chan (Dissection-chan) At Chuo Medical University, students prepare to dissect cadavers to study their anatomy. However, one group is in for a surprise when they unwrap their body bag to discover the woman inside is still alive! Ruriko Tamiya is a psychotic girl obsessed with being dissected. As a child, she would carve open small animals' stomachs while her unwilling accomplice Tatsuro Kamata would hold them down. Tatsuro was able to escape her influence, but now, eight years later, she begs him to open her stomach. What horrors lurk beneath her veneer of skin? Kuroi Tori (Blackbird) Crippled in the wilderness, Shiro Moriguchi survived for a month off the provisions in his backpack... or so he says. In truth, his survival depended on a mysterious bird-woman who fed him regurgitated raw meat. However, even Moriguchi's rescue can't save him from her far too \"caring\" tendencies, as she continues to force-feed him meat and organs of unknown origin. Nanakuse Magami (Magami Nanakuse) Magami Nanakuse is a talented author, whose stories focus on people with strange habits called \"tics.\" Despite their obscure status, Magami's books are addicting. One such avid fan is Kaoru Koketsu. An aspiring novelist herself, Kaoru receives the chance of a lifetime when Magami invites Kaoru to visit. However, this visit doesn't turn out happy; Magami declares Kaoru a \"tic faker,\" ranting on the poor girl. After drinking together, their conversation leads Magami to see a spark of potential in Kaoru—the ultimate tic. Mimikosuru Onna (Whispering Woman) Mayumi Santo only knows how to live by taking orders. Should she sit, and if so, how should she sit? Does she lower her bottom first, or does she bend her knees first? Every one of Mayumi's actions requires strict direction for her to feel sane. Though her father Shigeki loves her, he is at wits' end as every caretaker eventually quits. His saving grace comes in the form of Mitsu Uchida, a beautiful young lady who offers to become the next caretaker. Despite Shigeki's initial misgivings, Mitsu proves to be more adept than any before her. Still, the mystery remains—just who is Mitsu Uchida, and for what reasons does she go to such lengths to care for Mayumi? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Osamu Dazai's immortal—and supposedly autobiographical—work of Japanese literature, is perfectly adapted here into a manga by Junji Ito. The imagery wrenches open the text of the novel one line at a time to sublimate Yozo's mental landscape into something even more delicate and grotesque. This is the ultimate in art by Ito, proof that nothing can surpass the terror of the human psyche. (Source: VIZ Media)",

She notices something odd about the area: the volcanic hair bears a gold appearance, uncommon in Japan. Kyoko soon runs into a strange man named Aizawa, who proclaims he has been expecting her. Aizawa takes Kyoko to his village called Kiyokami, bathed in the same bright gold as the volcanic hair. There, she learns that the hair is known as \"Amagami,\" and it gives them the strange ability to sense the minds of fellow villagers. As Kyoko prepares to leave, the residents invite her to their routine stargazing. However, the ceremony is interrupted when thousands of flying objects cover the sky, and the villagers are suddenly struck with a tormenting vision of jet-black hair—eerily contrasting the comforting gold. In the morning, it is announced that Mount Sengoku has erupted. The rescue team discovers Kyoko in the debris, now sporting the golden hair coloring of the Amagami. Now, with the unusual phenomenon and the dark visions that the village has seen in deep space, an unknown terror threatens to be unleashed. Kyoko must save the world before the cosmic nightmare wreaks havoc on humanity. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "In a high school classroom, students mourn the loss of one of their own: Tomie Kawakami, who has been murdered and dismembered. Shocked by the announcement of her death, the class is puzzled by the cruel fate that has befallen someone so dear to them; such a radiant and beautiful girl did not deserve such a hideous demise. However, a strikingly familiar student suddenly appears at the classroom's entrance. Gorgeous, slender, and with a beauty mark under her left eye, Tomie smiles and apologizes for being late. But this is just the beginning of the mysteries surrounding this seemingly inhuman woman. The men unlucky enough to catch her eye become smitten with her instantly, but also become driven by a dark impulse to dismember her, one they often succumb to. And each time, Tomie returns from the dead to continue her favorite pastime: toying with men. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As you can imagine, I wasn't really expecting much and was very impressed by what I read. I loved every chapter and felt they were all very original and well thought out to how each 'Tomie' manipulated and charmed each character in the manga which eventually ends in her own demise.\n\nArt - As the other review has mentioned, the one strength to this anime is that Tomie is truely beautifully drawn in the manga with her beautiful eyes and shiny hair and there is a lot of attention to detail, especially when her beautiful form is distorted by the 'monster' beneath.\n\nCharacter - The smaller characters are simply prop to the many 'Tomies' that prop up in all the stories. It is especially unkind to the men who fall madly for Tomie in each arc. Not much is known about Tomie except for her supernatural abilities and as you get more and more used to her character, the stories seem to get more complicated and baffling. Great! And a real challenge for the mind!\n\nEnjoyment - I throughly enoyed 'Tomie' and despite it not being as 'terrifying' as I thought it could be, I found it was a very interesting concept about a strange multiplying girl with no purpose but to make people love her as much as she loves herself.\n\nOverall - Definitely an interesting manga if you like different story arcs and strange characters and plotlines. It can be a little gory/strange in places but hey - what can you do?!",

                "review": "There are many horror mangas out there that try to make themselves scary. But often we just get a comic that's more gory or disgusting than scary. Now there is Kazuo Umezu who really can write a horror story that'll scare you. He is known as the godfather of horror manga, but there is another called Junji Ito called the master of horror manga who has wrote something just as terrifying as any scary movie, book, or comic out there. This story is called Uzumaki.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is simply starts us of quick with two main characters to get use to and the setting for our horror manga. Right away, we get the feeling that something isn't actually right in this little coastal town. Soon, after the first chapter we get our first freak out and scary moment that is very twisted. The story is written well and focuses on something that really isn't scary to begin with, a simple spiral.\n\nBut as this story shows, there is much more to this symbol then meets the eye.\n\nAs the story moves along, each chapter presents us a separate story that is completely different than the last, but still connects to the main plot. We get strange stories about a lighthouse, crazy hair, giant snails, and twisting bodies that all go together into this spiral story, no pun intended. But some of these stories within the story aren't actually really horrific or anything which is why this grade isn't a 10.\n\nArt:\n\nThis story really is scary and what helps it is its sick and creepy style art. These characters are really well drawn and have a small alteration that makes them different than another person, though a lot of the girls seem similar to me and at one point I could tell two of them apart from each other.\n\nNow let's look at the world itself. It really is drawn well and if you look closer enough, you'll find spirals that aren't even apart of the story at hand. There's also the carnage and scenes of disturbing violence in the story, now this stuff is freaky. This story contains a lot of this story and unlike most stories, it actually makes this story scarier!\n\nCharacter:\n\nLike I mention before, we are instantly given our two main characters right off the bat that both provide two different personalities. The girl is a bit uneasy and refuses to believe a lot of the things happening around her for a while and there is her boyfriend who is really nervous about the town and believes there isn't something right about it.\n\nThen we get the rest of the cast&hellip; there isn't much of a cast besides these two. The only people that make repeat appearances are Kirie's mom, brother, and dad plus one of her friends occasionally. Everyone else that has a big part in one of the chapters is pretty much a one time appearance. It's kind of annoying that you get to know a new character only to never see them again.\n\nEnjoyment:\n\nThis series is extremely rewarding if you get it a chance and you'll for sure think there is no other horror story around that can reach this level of freakiness. But this story might not appeal to everyone. Some might be put off by the crazy images or might find this story not that scary but just disturbing. Either way, this story provides a chilling, but enjoyable ride from beginning to end if you find that you like this series.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis story might not appeal to everyone like said before, but a lot of people should at least read the first chapter before making their judgment. You never know, you could be missing out on a great horror manga and you could never have even known!\n\nThis series contains a lot of disturbing images, violence and gore, nudity, language, and intense scenes of horror. If find any of this not really your style, especially the disturbing images, avoid this series at all costs!",

                "review": "Manga and anime do not scare me easily. Disturb me in some cases with grotesque imagery and copious amounts of gore, yes, but nothing that would constitute in giving me nightmares. I've found the medium as something that I would always gain enjoyment from no matter the genre. I would spend my time with a work, ponder on it for a while, and leave it at that. Rinse and repeat. That is, until I came across Junji Ito's Uzumaki.\n\nThe manga is brief, as it is only 19 chapters long with one extra story, but it drags the reader through so much. The manga's first two chapters set the stage for all the events that are to follow: a man's obsession with all things spiral-shaped, smoke that forms a spiral when it reaches the sky, the protagonist's boyfriend becoming paranoid over the mysterious activities that have been occurring in the small, sea-side town where the story is set, and so on. Once the main points of the story are established, Ito assumes that the reader is aware of the basics and takes a completely episodic approach with his storytelling until the last few chapters. Each chapter is dedicated to one object that is associated with spirals, notably snails and curly hair. He sometimes cuts corners with this concept, though, and dedicates chapters to mosquitoes and lighthouses (Apparently, his excuse for this is that they move around in spiral shapes). What the reader doesn't realize, though, is that this is all build-up for the conclusion of the story, making this one of the most depressing manga I have ever read. I won't say much to avoid spoiling you, but the spiral concept of the story becomes all the more encompassing. Part of the horror that comes from this story is obsession and giving in to that obsession. It comes from watching the gradual downfall of a once peaceful town that has its daily life completely transformed (no pun intended...oops) by the psychological breakdowns of its townspeople. It comes from some of the characters' realization of what is going on, screaming in fear that they don't want to die, and knowing that they not only do not have any control over the situation, but that they know that they will never be the same again. I could go on, but my point is that the horror in this is completely psychological, but this is not Perfect Blue we're talking about. The terror in this is slow and painful, making the story all the more engrossing and terrifying.\n\nAnother major part of the story's appeal is Ito's unique drawing style. You could probably read the manga just for the artwork and still gain some enjoyment from that...that is, if you don't suddenly close your book in shock. It's one thing to read in text what is going on and another to see it. The artwork magnifies the reader's imagination hundredfold and presents possibly the only way to visually express everything that Kirie, the protagonist, is experiencing. Some of the scarier images include Shuichi's father rolling up his tongue into a spiral, half-human/snail hybrids, an army of pregnant women with blood-stained drills, and the lost souls that are the townspeople of Kurozu-cho who have resigned to the fate of \"becoming one with the spiral\", so to speak. That's not even half of the grotesqueness that the art has to offer. Some of the less scary art, such as the spiral-shaped grass and amusingly-spiraled hair, are cool to look at, but at the later points in the chapters, those only serve as distractions from the horror contained within the story. My favorite aspect of the art, however, is the fact that some of the worst images are usually hidden as two-page spreads beneath some of more harmless panels on the previous page. It's almost as if Ito is daring the reader to look on to the next page. One prominent example can be found in the \"moon scar\" chapter, and you'll know what I mean once you read it. That sort of suspense made the manga all the more thrilling to read. The art is not only creative and nice to look at, but adds its own layer of horror to the story.\n\nI feel bad for the characters in the story. I really do. By the end of the manga, they almost become completely different people. Even Kirie, who seems to consistently remain pure and untainted by the spiral's allure, has trouble facing some of the greater moral choices that she has to make during the story. She is always exposed to some kind of human flaw that is caused by the spiral's influence, such as vanity and lack of motivation. Because of how consistent Kirie remains through all of this, she seems almost like a Mary Sue character. Normally, this can be harmful to character development, and it is in some cases, but in the world of Uzumaki, her innocence is a virtue. She is spared from experiencing the same kind of insanity and corruption as her peers, and yet she has to witness everything first hand. At the same time, it seems like that that is her form of corruption, watching her family, significant other, and the people of her home gleefully give in to the madness surrounding them. Although that is not a form of character growth in the most traditional sense, the characters are growing based on the events happening to them rather than conjuring some kind of growth based on dialogue and interaction. Uzumaki has a very isolated form of character development that occurs in the foreground due to the highly-detailed story elements that take center stage.\n\nBefore I finish, I would like to state that this is a review for a manga that I read last, for the first time, in June 2011. The story, imagery, and overall package that this manga contains has stuck with me since. I still get chills from this manga whenever I get flashbacks to it. I might have even experienced a few nightmares from this story a short while after reading it, but my memory of that is a little hazy. Leave it to Junji Ito to take some of the most insignificant things that we take for granted and enlarge them into things to avoid with dread and disgust. If you are looking for some great Lovecraftian horror to sink your teeth into for Halloween, or anytime for that matter, look no further than this manga. Just be weary of any escargot on the menu next time you eat at a fancy restaurant.",

        "synopsis": "Yuuma Azawa is a transfer student with an odd habit: he cannot stop apologizing. Taking pity on him, Keiko Arisu, his new classmate, insists he should stop, but all Yuuma responds with is a string of apologies. The bizarre encounters continue when Keiko notices a strange girl following her, eerily proclaiming that she wants to suck her brains out. Running in fear, Keiko jumps in a truck's way and ends up hospitalized. Yuuma pays Keiko a visit in the hospital and confesses that the girl she met is his younger sister, Chizumi. Befriending Chizumi, Keiko discovers Yuuma's dark past: he once summoned the devil and became obsessed, profusely apologizing as a form of a wicked offering. Still freaked out, Keiko returns to school; however, everyone’s brains terrifyingly melt out of their skulls—and according to Chizumi, it is Yuuma's apologies that caused it. Keiko manages to escape before meeting the same fate, but miseries and misfortune that would befall those around the demonic siblings seem like just the beginning.

Almost a century later, Japanese diplomat Mamoru Yuki is labelled the \"Rasputin of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\" after being arrested on suspicions of breach of trust. Under these false accusations, Yuki starts an uphill battle of proving his innocence in a legal system notorious for its unforgiving verdicts. The prosecution is seeking to force a false confession out of him, his colleagues and trusted ones have betrayed him, and he is painfully dehumanized by the country he faithfully served. With the world against him, Yuki wrestles with upholding his own morals while trying to unearth the unsettling truth. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
