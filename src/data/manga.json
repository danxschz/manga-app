Attacked by a strange, four-legged fish in their cabin, they manage to kill it, but are left unsettled by the putrid stench it carried—the haunting smell of death. This lone assault is only the herald of what's to come, as soon, many more such creatures emerge from the sea, attacking anything in their path. Though Tadashi and Kaori quickly return to Tokyo, they find there is no longer any safe haven; no matter where they run, the death stench creeps... Amigara Dansou no Kai (The Enigma of Amigara Fault) After a devastating earthquake near Amigara mountain, a several-kilometer-long fault emerged. But this discovery was made more eerie by the thousands of human-shaped holes scattered among the rock face, each of which seemingly continues for miles within the mountain. Oowaki, one of the many spectators attracted to the sight, witnesses in horror as onlookers start to experience a personal, visceral calling to enter these holes—formed as if to fit only them. Daikokubashira Hiwa (The Sad Tale of the Principal Post) Celebrating their recent move into their new house, a family's festivities are cut short upon hearing the cries of their father. Finding him in the crawl space below, they bear witness to the bizarre and unexplainable tragedy that has befallen him. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Years later, Haruhiko receives a letter from Yukihiko, inviting him to his house.

Unable to discern where the blood came from or to get their car working again, the couple venture off the road for help. Though they come across a group of boys, these eerie children only attack the couple and attempt to suck their blood. Chased into an abandoned village, the pair find shelter in a mansion occupied by the village's sole inhabitant. Staying the night, the man begins to recount to them a strange and sorrowful tale of his past, the tragic circumstances of the town, and the existence of a phenomena known as blood-bubbles that links them all. Taegatai Meiro (Unbearable Labyrinth) Sayako is a troubled youth who has stopped attending school due to a personal trauma. Out of concern, her friend Noriko takes her on a hike in the calm mountainside, hoping to convince her to return. They get lost on the trail and come across a group of monks. However, their requests for assistance are only met by vacant stares from the gaunt men.

The girls are invited to spend the night at the temple, where they will find out the extremes that the monks will go through to achieve their nirvana.

Isho (The Will) Hiroko's younger sister Taeko has committed suicide by jumping in front of a train. A note she left behind reveals she killed herself out of hatred, but her blood obscured who the letter was addressed to. Taeko had always felt that Hiroko was treated better than her, and died after finding out she was adopted, causing Hiroko and her family to fear they may have been the cause of Taeko's death. When a vengeful spirit appears in their house, they start to fear that their worries have been realized... Hashi (The Bridge) After receiving a worrying call from her grandmother Osode, Kanako decides to visit her village. Upon arriving, an old figure stands at the bridge, but much to her horror, Kanako finds that this figure is a walking corpse. Osode explains that the man is actually her long-deceased uncle, and is tethered to the mortal realm as a result of the village's unique funeral practice. However, this single entity is not Osode's main problem; as of late, all the trapped souls of the village have appeared, urging Osode to join them in their rest.

However, when a tape recorder that he had mischievously slipped into her bag prior finds its way back to him, he realizes that it will serve as a key to the mystery. As Okamori listens to the tape, he comes to hear of the sinister being that Morimoto met in her last hour... Aibeya (The Conversation Room) Following a sudden car accident, Hashimoto awakens in a hospital ward. She finds herself in the company of Sugie, the woman she crashed into, and four other female patients.

This quartet acts in unison, claim that their hearts are one, and even seem to share the same dreams. Above all, they do not wish to be separated. As she spends more time in the hospital, Hashimoto starts to learn about the horrifying truth behind these women and the danger of staying with them. [Written by MAL Rewrite] \n1.

        "synopsis": "Kao Dorobou (The Face Burglar) When problem student Yumi Machida transfers to a new school, one sight stands out to her: two girls in her class look like identical twins. Very soon one of the twins starts following Yumi around, much to her chagrin. Yumi finds that this girl, known as Kamei, is determined to be with her as often as possible. However, despite attempting to ward Kamei away, Yumi finds herself swept into a sinister plan, for Kamei is neither who she says she is, nor who she appears to be. Kakashi (Scarecrows) Though it's been weeks since her funeral, Numata consistently visits his daughter Yuki's grave. When he spots Toshio—Yuki's former lover—paying his respects, he blames him for her death. In an impulsive rage, Numata plucks a scarecrow from the nearby fields and posts it in Yuki's grave to ward Toshio off. When he later comes to remove the scarecrow, Numata finds that its appearance has somewhat changed. In a matter of days, it now closely resembles his deceased daughter. Soon, the whole village follows suit, planting scarecrows into their loved one's graves to bring back their semblance. But with their return come the secrets that they were supposed to be buried with. Rakka (Falling) In the midst of an outbreak of suicides, a man catches his wife Erika trying to hang herself. Though he is able to rescue her, all she asks him thereafter is why he didn't let her die. The following day, Erika, along with hundreds of patients, hypnotically leave the hospital and disappear from the town completely. The town looks but to no avail, only finding Erika in a tree, still wishing to die. Clueless as to what is happening, the answer will soon come falling down to them. Akai Ito (Red String) Ishii has been dumped by his girlfriend Momoko Sakurai, leading him to skip school for the next three days in order to get over his heartache. When he returns, he discovers some strange red stitching on his wrist, and even more on his stomach later. With no help from doctors and no way to cut it, Ishii must struggle to discover the source and cure of his rapidly developing problem before it completely envelops him. Gosenzo-sama (My Dear Ancestors) When Makita finds his friend Risa aimlessly wandering through town, he discovers that she has lost her memories. Seeking medical help, the doctor determines that she likely witnessed something traumatic before losing her memories. Recuperating at home, Risa is plagued by nightmares of giant caterpillars but is no closer to revealing what she saw. Makita wants to help bring back her memories, and requests her to come over to his house. However, Risa only feels unease upon entering... Kubitsuri Kikyuu (The Hanging Balloons) Kazuko's friend, the popular idol Fujino Terumi, has committed suicide by hanging herself in public. As the news of her death spreads around, so does a wave of copycat suicides, giving rise to rumors of Terumi's ghost. With these rumors come strange but detailed reports that Terumi's ghost has manifested as her giant, floating head. As Kazuko starts to investigate, she realizes that these strange incidents are merely the beginning of the end.",

While his parents are out working abroad, he lives alone in a big mansion, compounding his loneliness and affecting his grip on reality. Moreover, strange things tend to happen to him and those he gets involved with.

Yet with each inexplicable occurrence, his reality alters slightly between the last. Just what is the truth behind these discrepancies? Is this really happening to the same Oshikiri?

She constantly dreams of her classmate Kishimoto, but as he hardly stands out, she is puzzled as to why he appears so often. Her friend suggests an answer: Kishimoto may be whispering to her in her sleep to influence her thoughts. Ready to confront him, Saiko soon finds this act to be merely the beginning of a strange series of events threatening to rob all of her privacy. Near Miss! Former university classmates, Konishi, Kawaguchi, and Takashio are set for a long overdue reunion. With Kawaguchi already having met up with Konishi and his sister, the group waits for Takashio's plane to land. However, when they discover that his flight has apparently gone missing, Konishi takes immediate action and heads to the airstrip. Together, the group sets out in Konishi's plane to find their friend, but nothing can prepare them for the sight they witness. Chizu no Machi (Maptown) On their honeymoon, Miki and Hiroshi spontaneously decide on a town to visit and celebrate in. They end up picking Shirube, whose streets are riddled with maps and guideposts, something they pass off as the quaintness of the location. Soon, they discover that the residents cannot get by without these maps, as the longer one stays in Shirube, the worse their sense of direction becomes. However, after hearing that there is also a hidden treasure within the town, the newlyweds decide to search for this prize, taking the risk that Shirube presents. Siren no Mura (Village of the Siren) In the midst of a nationwide epidemic of infant abductions, Kyouichi finds himself returning to his home village after receiving word that his parents have abandoned their farmwork in favor of working at the village's new factory. Kyouichi is puzzled, as his parents had been deeply passionate about their farm, making their abrupt decision nonsensical. At the village, he finds nothing but oddities: the desertion of the village, the few remaining people exhibiting strange behaviour, and the even fewer normal ones gripped in fear of the factory's siren. By evening, when the siren rings through the village, the terrible truth is revealed to Kyouichi. Choushizen Tenkousei (The Supernatural Transfer Student) The supernatural club is home to believers and performers of the strange and paranormal. Hikaru Shibayama can bend spoons with his mind and Kiyoshi Kitagawa can see the inner spirits of people and objects. When new transfer student Ryou Tsukano expresses his love for the occult, he seems a natural fit for the club and joins. But the group soon finds Ryou to be a frightening addition to the club, for his very presence is an invitation for the bizarre. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Upon visiting her house, Rie finds Yuuko bedridden and tenaciously adamant that no one sees what is happening to her; for Yuuko, an irreversible Kafkaesque transformation has already begun. Hyouchakubutsu (Out of Its Element/Thing that Drifted Ashore) A strange sea creature unlike anything seen before has drifted ashore. Like something out of a nightmare, this massive, eel-like monstrosity attracts a crowd of curious onlookers. But as they begin to investigate further, the sickening truth of this beast bursts forth. Kabi (Mold) After a year of working abroad, Akasaka finally returns home to enjoy the comfort of his house. At his brother's insistence, Akasaka had reluctantly rented it out to his former science teacher Mr. Shimao Rogi and his family. Now, upon his return, he finds the house in a filthy state and the Rogi family is nowhere to be seen. His problems only worsen once he finds mold all over the place, relentlessly spreading through every crevice, threatening to engulf his home and him with it. Samuke (Shiver/Coldness) In the backyard of his housing complex, Yuuji often spots his neighbour Rina, an odd girl with mysterious holes throughout her arms. Her strange condition reminds Yuuji of a grim memory: when he was a boy, his grandfather had succumbed to a disease that also covered his body with holes. When he consults his friend Hideo about the connection, the two discover a journal kept by Yuuji's grandfather and find themselves closer to understanding the chilling truth of this enigmatic condition. Ryokan When Mitsuyo was young, her father was overtaken by a strange passion to convert their house into a traditional inn. No matter how much her mother reminded him of the sheer impracticability of his goal, he refused to listen. As their father was driven to madness, Mitsuyo and her mother soon left. Intrigued by her story, Mitsuyo's friend decides to seek out the inn and see how it has fared in the 10 years since their departure.

Bio House Kubota, a new secretary at a biotechnology firm, has been invited to dinner at the company president's mansion. Business talks are not the main course of the evening however; both are interested in \"gross\" foods, and the president has prepared a grand banquet of odd delicacies. Although Kubota may have a fondness for the cuisine, the president's tastes prove to be more than she can chew. What's more, when Kubota rejects the president's downright revolting \"special dish,\" she finds that her night of torment has only just begun. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thanks to the unique weather, one game has become commonplace among the residents: intersection fortune-telling, where strangers meet up at crossroads to ask for anonymous advice. Though fun and exciting for most, this game holds nothing but dark memories for Ryuusuke, for when he was a child, his involvement had disastrous results for the other player. As a result, these memories hinder Ryuusuke's return to the town, as well as his reunion with his childhood friend Midori Shibayama. With Ryuusuke's arrival however, a new figure emerges in this game: the Intersections Pretty Boy. This devilishly handsome but wicked presence gives nothing but cruel and harsh advice to anyone who has the misfortune of crossing his path. What's more, his advice has bewitching effects on those he encounters. With tragic results spreading as a consequence, Ryuusuke determines to prevent this man from repeating the past. But can he stop this enigmatic figure, or do only torment and misery await those who try? [Written by MAL Rewrite] \n1. Yotsutsuji no Bishounen (The Beautiful Youth of the Intersections) \n2.

Having passed out in shock, Victor awakens to find his creation gone. Soon, he works to forget his former passion and distance himself from his transgression. However, when the creature reemerges into his life, Victor finds he must deal with a vengeance-seeking fiend, lest he lose all that he holds precious in life.

Though the couple love their daughter, they must decide their course of action: bury her and end their torment, or spare her no matter what she may become. Real Unko no Omoide (Memories of Real Shit) The horror mangaka Junji Itou recalls a vivid memory from his childhood. When at a festival, he came across a stall that seemed to sell real feces.

The discovery propels the professor into the public eye, where he is met with accolades, acclaim, and the rights to name the planet. Deciding to let his daughter Remina serve as the namesake, the shy girl quickly finds herself thrust into an uneasy life of stardom. Unlike its human counterpart, planet Remina shows nothing but odd behavior. Its movements are unpredictable and show no clear orbital patterns. Even more mysterious, any star it nears soon disappears. The enigma heightens when Professor Ooguro's assistant claims that planet Remina has stopped moving and looked him directly in the eye. Before going mad, the assistant announces one final thing: the planet is now heading toward Earth. Soon enough, planet Remina enters the solar system, leaving a trail of emptiness and causing worldwide panic. In an instant, popular adoration transforms into hostility; the populace have declared that the Ooguros have orchestrated this disaster and must be destroyed to avert it. Now deemed Public Enemy No. 1, Remina must escape a rabid population, all while the looming threat of the hellstar approaches. [Written by MAL Rewrite] Included one-shot: Okuman Bocchi",

        "synopsis": "Futon After eloping, Madoka and Tomio should have been happy. But shortly afterwards, Tomio refuses to leave his futon. As he burrows in its folds, what sort of unseen horror is he hiding from? Mokuzou no Kai (Wooden Spirit) More than anything else, Megumi and her father are proud of their house's pedigree, as it has been recently honored as a national tangible cultural property. This renown draws the interest of architecture student Manami Kino, who ends up boarding alongside the father-daughter pair. As Manami becomes more ingrained in their lives, she reveals tell-tale signs of her love for the house. Tomio: Akai High-neck (Tomio・Red Turtleneck) Clad in a crimson turtleneck and clutching the sides of his head, Tomio begs for his ex-girlfriend Madoka's help. The enchanting fortune-teller who stole his heart now wants to steal another thing—Tomio's head. Lacerations wind around his neck, and the only thing keeping him whole is the waning strength of his hands. Yuruyaka na Wakare (Gentle Goodbye) Against his family's wishes, Makoto Tokura marries Riko. Soon, she learns of the family's special ritual. They have the ability to bring back the ghosts of the dead, calling them \"afterimages.\" After a couple of decades, these afterimages will fade, but they grant family members the chance to say a gentle goodbye to loved ones. Riko hopes the family can bring back the afterimage of her father when he dies, but even after years, they still don't approve of her. What secret could they be hiding? Kaibou-chan (Dissection-chan) At Chuo Medical University, students prepare to dissect cadavers to study their anatomy. However, one group is in for a surprise when they unwrap their body bag to discover the woman inside is still alive! Ruriko Tamiya is a psychotic girl obsessed with being dissected. As a child, she would carve open small animals' stomachs while her unwilling accomplice Tatsuro Kamata would hold them down. Tatsuro was able to escape her influence, but now, eight years later, she begs him to open her stomach. What horrors lurk beneath her veneer of skin? Kuroi Tori (Blackbird) Crippled in the wilderness, Shiro Moriguchi survived for a month off the provisions in his backpack... or so he says. In truth, his survival depended on a mysterious bird-woman who fed him regurgitated raw meat. However, even Moriguchi's rescue can't save him from her far too \"caring\" tendencies, as she continues to force-feed him meat and organs of unknown origin. Nanakuse Magami (Magami Nanakuse) Magami Nanakuse is a talented author, whose stories focus on people with strange habits called \"tics.\" Despite their obscure status, Magami's books are addicting. One such avid fan is Kaoru Koketsu. An aspiring novelist herself, Kaoru receives the chance of a lifetime when Magami invites Kaoru to visit. However, this visit doesn't turn out happy; Magami declares Kaoru a \"tic faker,\" ranting on the poor girl. After drinking together, their conversation leads Magami to see a spark of potential in Kaoru—the ultimate tic. Mimikosuru Onna (Whispering Woman) Mayumi Santo only knows how to live by taking orders. Should she sit, and if so, how should she sit? Does she lower her bottom first, or does she bend her knees first? Every one of Mayumi's actions requires strict direction for her to feel sane. Though her father Shigeki loves her, he is at wits' end as every caretaker eventually quits. His saving grace comes in the form of Mitsu Uchida, a beautiful young lady who offers to become the next caretaker. Despite Shigeki's initial misgivings, Mitsu proves to be more adept than any before her. Still, the mystery remains—just who is Mitsu Uchida, and for what reasons does she go to such lengths to care for Mayumi? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Osamu Dazai's immortal—and supposedly autobiographical—work of Japanese literature, is perfectly adapted here into a manga by Junji Ito. The imagery wrenches open the text of the novel one line at a time to sublimate Yozo's mental landscape into something even more delicate and grotesque. This is the ultimate in art by Ito, proof that nothing can surpass the terror of the human psyche. (Source: VIZ Media)",

Aizawa takes Kyoko to his village called Kiyokami, bathed in the same bright gold as the volcanic hair. There, she learns that the hair is known as \"Amagami,\" and it gives them the strange ability to sense the minds of fellow villagers. As Kyoko prepares to leave, the residents invite her to their routine stargazing. However, the ceremony is interrupted when thousands of flying objects cover the sky, and the villagers are suddenly struck with a tormenting vision of jet-black hair—eerily contrasting the comforting gold. In the morning, it is announced that Mount Sengoku has erupted. The rescue team discovers Kyoko in the debris, now sporting the golden hair coloring of the Amagami. Now, with the unusual phenomenon and the dark visions that the village has seen in deep space, an unknown terror threatens to be unleashed. Kyoko must save the world before the cosmic nightmare wreaks havoc on humanity. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Shocked by the announcement of her death, the class is puzzled by the cruel fate that has befallen someone so dear to them; such a radiant and beautiful girl did not deserve such a hideous demise. However, a strikingly familiar student suddenly appears at the classroom's entrance. Gorgeous, slender, and with a beauty mark under her left eye, Tomie smiles and apologizes for being late. But this is just the beginning of the mysteries surrounding this seemingly inhuman woman. The men unlucky enough to catch her eye become smitten with her instantly, but also become driven by a dark impulse to dismember her, one they often succumb to. And each time, Tomie returns from the dead to continue her favorite pastime: toying with men. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Taking pity on him, Keiko Arisu, his new classmate, insists he should stop, but all Yuuma responds with is a string of apologies. The bizarre encounters continue when Keiko notices a strange girl following her, eerily proclaiming that she wants to suck her brains out. Running in fear, Keiko jumps in a truck's way and ends up hospitalized. Yuuma pays Keiko a visit in the hospital and confesses that the girl she met is his younger sister, Chizumi. Befriending Chizumi, Keiko discovers Yuuma's dark past: he once summoned the devil and became obsessed, profusely apologizing as a form of a wicked offering. Still freaked out, Keiko returns to school; however, everyone’s brains terrifyingly melt out of their skulls—and according to Chizumi, it is Yuuma's apologies that caused it. Keiko manages to escape before meeting the same fate, but miseries and misfortune that would befall those around the demonic siblings seem like just the beginning.

Under these false accusations, Yuki starts an uphill battle of proving his innocence in a legal system notorious for its unforgiving verdicts.
